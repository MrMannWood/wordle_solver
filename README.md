# Wordle Solver

I was curious about different algorithms for finding the best guesses for the game [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). This is a simple sandbox for testing out algorithms.

The dictionary in use is only 5 letter English words.

Results from the current algorithm:

| Number of Words | Number of Guesses |
|---|---|
|5|9|
|52|8|
|320|7|
|1298|6|
|4246|5|
|5403|4|
|1606|3|
|41|2|
|1|1|

Words that took more 5 guesses: 1675

Words that took 5 guesses or fewer: 11297
