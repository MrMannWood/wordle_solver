# Wordle Solver

I was curious about different algorithms for finding the best guesses for the game [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). This is a simple sandbox for testing out algorithms.

The dictionary in use is only 5 letter English words.

Results from the current algorithm:
|Guesses|Words|
|---|---|
|9|5|
|8|52|
|7|320|
|6|1298|
|5|4246|
|4|5403|
|3|1606|
|2|41|
|1|1|

Words that took 5 or more guesses: 1675

Words that took 5 guesses or fewer: 11297
