# Wordle Solver

I was curious about different algorithms for finding the best guesses for the game [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). This is a simple sandbox for testing out algorithms.

The dictionary in use is only 5 letter English words.

Results from the current algorithm:
|Guesses|Words|
|---|---|
|7|12|
|6|148|
|5|646|
|4|1145|
|3|362|
|2|2|

Words that took 6 or more guesses: 12

Words that took 6 guesses or fewer: 2303

% of Words that took 6 guesses or fewer: 99.4816414686825
