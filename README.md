# Wordle Solver
_______

I was curious about different algorithms for finding the best guesses for the game [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). This is a simple sandbox for testing out algorithms.

The dictionary in use is only 5 letter English words.

Results from the current algorithm:

5 words took 9 guesses
52 words took 8 guesses
320 words took 7 guesses
1298 words took 6 guesses
4246 words took 5 guesses
5403 words took 4 guesses
1606 words took 3 guesses
41 words took 2 guesses
1 words took 1 guesses
Words that took more 5 guesses: 1675
Words that took 5 guesses or fewer: 11297
